A raw ***C*** and ***Rust*** arithmetic interpreters. Goes through 3 stages, Scanning, Parsing and Compiling. I've rewrite the C version to Rust, for the better error handling and better code structuring and you can also observe the different in two approaches in implementing the same programin ***Rust*** and ***C***.
