# Computer Science Fundamental Projects

## Description
This repository is a collection of foundational computer science projects or research developed to reinforce core concepts through hands-on implementation. Each project or research focuses on a fundamental area of computer science, such as memory management, systems programming, or software architecture and is written in different programming languages.

The purpose of this work is to go beyond theoretical learning by building low-level systems and tools from scratch, encouraging a deeper understanding of how computers operate at both the hardware and software levels. It also serves as a way to explore different programming paradigms and improve proficiency across multiple languages.

I strongly recommend reviewing the ***Fearless Concurrency*** directory, as it contains fundamental knowledge of concurrency in the Rust programming language.
