# Computer Science Fundamental Projects

## Description
This repository is a collection of foundational computer science projects developed to reinforce core concepts through hands-on implementation. Each project focuses on a fundamental area of computer science—such as memory management, systems programming, or software architecture—and is written in different programming languages.

The purpose of this work is to go beyond theoretical learning by building low-level systems and tools from scratch, encouraging a deeper understanding of how computers operate at both the hardware and software levels. It also serves as a way to explore different programming paradigms and improve proficiency across multiple languages.

## Projects
- [**Manual Memory Allocator**](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Computer-Science-Fundamentals/tree/main/MALLOC) implemented in C. It includes malloc, calloc, realloc and free.
- [**Garbage Collection**](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Computer-Science-Fundamentals/tree/main/GC) written in C++. I used previously implemented *memory allocator*, extended it for GC usage. In consequence, I've build a *Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collection Cycle*.
- [**Web Server**](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Computer-Science-Fundamentals/tree/main/Web-Server) coded in Rust. I've also used some html & css to show the actual result.
- [**Arithmetic Interpreter**](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Computer-Science/tree/main/ARITHMETIC-INTERPRETER) is a simple expression parser, evaluator, and compiler for arithmetic expressions.
- [**Async Queue**]() is an implementation of async queues.
