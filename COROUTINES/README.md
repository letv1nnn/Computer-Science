# Coroutines in Rust

## Description
This directory is made for educational purposes, I explored how to use coroutines in Rust language. Also, I use tokio async runtime to extend the basic async tasks with coroutine adaptors. I've also explored coroutine unit-testing in Rust.

## Build

### Cloning
```bash
git clone https://github.com/letv1nnn/Computer-Science.git
cd Computer-Science/COROUTINES-RUST/
```

### Building and running
There are two cargo projects. ***Coroutines***, illustrates fundamentals in coroutine. ***Testing-Coroutines***, shows how to test them.
```bash
cd "cargo_project"
cargo run
```
